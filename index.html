					<h1>About Me</h1>
					<p class="introduction">Greetings, I am a recent University Graduate in Web Development with knowledge of current technologies. I hope to expand my skillset by undertaking new projects and goals whilst also using the skills I have learned to create professional looking websites.</p>
					<p class="sub-text">
					Within University I was given a number of projects and assignments which tested my capabilities as a developer while also providing me the oppurtunity to learn about current technologies and practices. These assignments varied from creating responsive websites with CSS3 and HTML5 to creating data management sites by incorporating the use of PHP to alter changes to an SQL Database. 
					</p>
					<p class="sub-text">
					Other assignments focused on improving user experiences. This included using various methods such as reducing page refresh times with the use of AJAX (less time waiting for the page to load) but also on how to design a site so that it is accessable for all, regardless of issues with sight, body or mind.

In the final year I produced a final year project which was titled "A Comparison in Web Animations". This assignment involved researching the use of animations on the web and how animations on the web could be created realistically to better involve the user.<p>
