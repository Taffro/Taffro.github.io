					<p class="introduction">Greetings, I am a recent University Graduate in Web Development with knowledge of current technologies. I hope to expand my skillset by undertaking new projects and goals whilst also using the skills I have learned to create professional looking websites.</p>
					<p class="sub-text">
					Within University I was given a number of projects and assignments which tested my capabilities as a developer while also providing me with the oppurtunity to learn about current technologies and practices. These assignments varied from creating responsive websites with CSS3 and HTML5 to creating data management sites by incorporating the use of PHP to alter changes to an SQL Database. 
					</p>
					<p class="sub-text">
					Other assignments focused on improving user experiences. This included using various methods such as reducing page refresh times with the use of AJAX (less time waiting for the page to load) but also on how to design a site so that it is accessable for all, regardless of issues with sight, body or mind.

In the final year I produced a final year project which was titled "A Comparison in Web Animations". This assignment involved researching the use of animations on the web and how animations on the web could be created realistically to better involve the user.<p>

				<p class="educationLocation">PHP Design Patterns</p>
				<p class="sub-text">This assignment focused on the use of PHP design patterns and how they could be used to improve performances and flexibility of PHP applications. Within the assignment, different informational content were displayed through the three design patterns (Observer, Facade and Strategy).</p><p class="sub-text">To display this, a PHP application was created to display different content to the user depending on their authorization (standard user, admin) or whether they were logged into the application.</p>

				<p class="educationLocation">Investigation of JavaScript Frameworks, AJAX and HTML5</p>
				<p class="sub-text">
				The first stage of this assignment was to investigate popular JS frameworks (Anuglar.js, Ember.js, Backbone.js) and explain their benefits and use within the web industry.</p>

				<p class="sub-text">The next stage of the assignment was demonstrating the benefits of using AJAX within Web Applications. In particular the project demonstrated how AJAX could be used to make the application more user friendly by removing the period of which a user would have to wait for an action to be performed.

				Finally, the benefits of new web technologies such as HTML5 Video and audio as well as new technologies such as CSS3 was demonstrated.</p>

			<div class="column2">
				<p class="educationLocation">Single page applications using Backbone.Marionette.js</p>
				<p class="sub-text">This project focused on reducing the complexity of creating single-page applications when using standard jQuery. Backbone.js is a JavaScript library with a RESTful JSON interface.</p> <p class="sub-text">It is also based on the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) design pattern and was used within this project to demonstrate the benefits of using the library when creating single page applications. Another library that was used was the Marionette.js library which aims to alleviate many of the problems when developing Backbone.js applications.</p>

				<p class="sub-text">The first stage of the major project was to compose an investigation of the chosen technology and its use within the web industry.</p>

				<p class="sub-text">I also investigated the most popular web animation technologies as well as the newer technologies that have risen due to HTML5 and CSS3. Finally, I looked at how web animations can involve the user and improve their experience on the webpage and also how animations can detract from the user experience if used irresponsibly.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="column2">
				<p class="educationLocation">Development and Testing (Part Two)</p>
				<p class="sub-text">For the development phase, I created an application which would perform performance tests of popular animation technologies in order to test how they compare and perform on different browsers. The technologies included: Adobe Flash, CSS3, HTML5 Canvas and SVG</p> <p class="sub-text">I also applied animation principles to a simple animation using the 12 animation principles from Disney's: The Illusion of Life. This was performed in order to create more realistic animations on the web so that users can enjoy their web experience.</p>
